### 💡 Feature Requests

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it!

**In-App Method:**
1. Go to **Profile > Help & Support**
2. Tap **"Suggest a Feature"**

4. Submit your suggestion

#### What Makes a Good Feature Request

**Include These Details:**
- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Use case** - Why would this be helpful?
- **Target users** - Who would benefit from this feature?
- **Priority level** - How important is this to you?
- **Alternative solutions** - What do you currently do instead?

**Example Feature Request:**
```
Subject: Bulk check-in for team events

Description: 
Add ability for managers to check in multiple employees at once 
for team events, meetings, or training sessions.

Use Case:
When our team has off-site training, it's tedious for everyone 
to individually check in. A bulk check-in would save time and 
ensure everyone's attendance is recorded.

Target Users:
Managers and team leads who organize group activities

Priority: Medium
Currently we manually adjust attendance records after events.

Suggested Implementation:
- "Bulk Check-in" option in admin panel
- Select multiple employees from list
- Set common check-in time
- Add notes about the event
```
